# RESTful React
RESTful React refers to the use of the REST architecture style in conjunction with the React framework, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

When building a web application with React, it is common to use RESTful APIs to communicate with the server and retrieve data. This involves making HTTP requests using the standard GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods to access resources on the server.

The main advantage of using a RESTful API with React is that it allows for a separation of concerns between the client-side user interface and the server-side data management. The server can be built independently of the client, and can be swapped out or scaled up as needed without affecting the client-side code. Meanwhile, the React components can focus on rendering the user interface and responding to user interactions.

To implement RESTful APIs in React, developers typically use a library like Axios or Fetch to make HTTP requests to the server. They may also use React Router to handle routing and navigation within the client-side application.

Overall, using a RESTful architecture with React allows for a flexible, scalable, and maintainable web application architecture. It separates concerns between the client and server, and allows developers to build a robust and reliable system.
