## Helper Functions
```js
const Hello = (props) => {
  const bornYear = () => {
    const yearNow = new Date().getFullYear()
    return yearNow - props.age
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        Hello {props.name}, you are {props.age} years old
      </p>
      <p>So you were probably born in {bornYear()}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```
 The helper function is defined inside of another function that defines the behavior of our component. In Java programming, defining a function inside another one is complex and cumbersome, so not all that common. In JavaScript, however, defining functions within functions is a commonly-used technique.
