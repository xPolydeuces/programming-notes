## Effect Hooks
In React, effect hooks are a way to add side effects to a component's rendering cycle. Side effects are operations that modify something outside the component's scope, such as updating the DOM, fetching data, or subscribing to an external event.

Effect hooks are declared using the `useEffect()` function, which takes two arguments: a function that performs the side effect, and an optional array of dependencies that control when the effect should run.

Here's an example of a component that fetches data from an API and displays it in a list:
```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://myapi.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data))
      .catch(error => console.log(error));
  }, []);

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
    </ul>
  );
}
```
In this example, the `useEffect()` function is used to fetch data from an API and update the component's state with the retrieved data. The second argument of `useEffect()` is an empty array, which means that the effect will only run once when the component mounts. If we had passed an array of dependencies, the effect would run whenever any of those dependencies changed.

Effect hooks are a powerful tool in React that allows you to perform side effects in a declarative way, without having to worry about the details of when to run them. However, it's important to use them correctly to avoid performance issues and bugs.
