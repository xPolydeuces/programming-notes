# Supertest

Supertest is a JavaScript library that allows you to test HTTP servers by making requests to them and then verifying the responses. Supertest is commonly used in Node.js applications, especially those built on top of frameworks such as Express, Koa, or Hapi.

Supertest provides a simple and convenient API for writing tests that interact with HTTP servers. It allows you to make HTTP requests to your server and provides assertions to verify the responses. This means that you can write tests for your entire server, including routes, middleware, and error handling.

One of the benefits of using supertest is that it provides an abstraction layer over the HTTP protocol. This means that you can test your server without having to start it up and listen on a port. Supertest creates a fake server that responds to your requests, allowing you to test your server in isolation.

To use supertest, you first need to install it using npm:

```bash 
npm install supertest
```

Once installed, you can import it into your test files and use it to create a test suite for your server. Here's an example:

```js
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../app');

describe('Test the root path', () => {
  test('It should respond to the GET method', () => {
    return request(app)
      .get('/')
      .expect(200);
  });
});
```

In this example, we import supertest and our Express app. We then create a test suite that tests the root path of our server. We make a GET request to the root path using supertest, and we expect the response to have a status code of 200.

Overall, supertest is a powerful tool for testing HTTP servers in Node.js applications. It provides a simple and convenient API for writing tests, and it allows you to test your entire server, including routes, middleware, and error handling.
