# JavaScript

*JavaScript* is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website.

*JS* itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core *JS* language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:

* Browser *Application Programming Interfaces* (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
* Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
* Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to *HTML* to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.
