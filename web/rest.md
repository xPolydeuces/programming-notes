# REST
REST, or Representational State Transfer, is a popular architectural style for designing web-based systems. It is a set of principles that defines how web services should behave, and how they should interact with each other.

The key idea behind REST is that resources should be identified by unique URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), and that these resources can be manipulated using a set of standard operations, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. These operations are often referred to as HTTP methods, since they are based on the HTTP protocol.

REST also emphasizes the use of a uniform interface, which allows clients and servers to communicate in a standardized way. This makes it easier to build and maintain web services that can be used by a wide range of clients and applications.

Another important aspect of REST is that it is stateless, which means that each request from a client to a server contains all the information needed to complete the request. This allows for scalability and simplifies server-side logic, since the server doesn't need to keep track of any state information.

Overall, REST is a powerful and flexible architecture that is widely used for building web services and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It has become the de facto standard for building modern, scalable, and interoperable web-based systems.
