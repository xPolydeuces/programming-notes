# HTML

**HTML** stands for *HyperText Markup Language* and is used to create the structure and content of web pages.

## Basic Structure

A basic HTML document has the following structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Page content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```
The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration specifies that this is an HTML5 document. The `<html>` element is the root element of the page and it contains all other elements.

The `<head>` element contains metadata about the document, such as the title of the page, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab. The `<body>` element containts the content of the page, such as text, images and links.
