# A true full stack developer's oath

* I will have my browser developer console open all the time
* I will use the network tab of the browser dev tools to ensure that frontend and backend are communicating as I expect
* I will constantly keep on eye the state of the server to make sure that the data sent there by the frontend is saved there as I expect
* I will keep an eye on the database: does the backend save data there in the right format
* I will progress in small steps
* I will write lots of _console.log_ statements to make sure I understand how the code and the tests behave and to help pinpoint problems
* If my code does not work, I will not write more code. Instead, I start deleting the code until it works or just return to a state when everything was still working
* If a test does not pass, I make sure that the tested functionality for sure works in the application
* When I ask for help, I formulate my questions properly
