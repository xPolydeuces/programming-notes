# ESlint

Generically, lint or a linter is any tool that detects and flags errors in programming languages, including stylistic errors. The term lint-like behavior is sometimes applied to the process of flagging suspicious language usage. Lint-like tools generally perform static analysis of source code.

In the JavaScript universe, the current leading tool for static analysis aka. "linting" is `ESlint`.

To install `ESlint` use the following command:
```bash
npm install eslint --save-dev
```
To initialize a default ESlint configuration, use the following command:
```bash
npx eslint --init
```
