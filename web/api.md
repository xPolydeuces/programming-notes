# API
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of protocols, routines, and tools that allow software applications to communicate with each other. In simpler terms, an API acts as a bridge between two applications, enabling them to exchange information and interact with each other.

An API specifies how software components should interact and what kind of data can be exchanged between them. It provides a standardized way for developers to integrate different applications or services, without having to understand the underlying code or infrastructure.

APIs are used extensively in web and mobile applications, allowing developers to access services such as social media platforms, payment gateways, weather services, and many more. APIs are also used in enterprise systems, enabling applications to share data and functionality across different departments or systems.

Overall, APIs provide a way for developers to build better and more complex applications by leveraging the functionality of other applications and services, without having to build everything from scratch.
