## Create a React app

The easiest way (but not the best one, and actually not recommended to use by professionals) to create a React app is by using a tool called `create-react-app`. To initialize it, you can do it by writing the following command in the console:
```bash
npx create-react-app app-name
```
and run it with this command:
```bash
npm start
```
