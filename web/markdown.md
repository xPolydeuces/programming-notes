# Markdown (this is h1, using ```# syntax```)

## Headings (This is an h2, writing it like this ```## text```)
### This is an h3, writing it like this ```### text```
#### This is an h4, writing it like this ```#### text```
##### This is an h5, writing it like this ```##### text```
###### This is an h6, writing it like this ```###### text```

Markdown is very similar to the HTML. In fact, if we wanted to, we could write the headings using HTML, like this:
```html
<h3>This is also an h3!</h3>
```
The result is the same as with *###*.
## Text

This is a paragraph. It needs no extra syntax, as markdown formats it as one by default. HTML equivalent is ```<p>``` tag.

And this is another paragraph!

*Italics*? Write them like ```*this*``` or ```_this_```

**Bold** text? You can write it like ```**this**```

Including a picture works almost the same! You just need to add '!' before the square brackets, like this ```![alt text](url)```

To write in-line line of code, we need to use \`\`\` at the beginning and \`\`\` at the end, like ```this```.

To write a block of code, we do it same way, just over few lines. After the first three initial \`\`\` we can add information what language we are using, so the code can be displayed in the right format.

\`\`\`html  
\<p>Like this\</p>  
\`\`\`
```html
<p>The result!</p>
```

This is an unordered list:
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

And we do it like this:

\* Item 1  
\* Item 2  
\* Item 3  

And ordered list:
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

We can get like this:  
1\. Item 1  
2\. Item 2  
3\. Item 3
