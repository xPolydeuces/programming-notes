## The 1st rule of web development: 
Always keep the Developer Console open on your web browser.

## HTTP
*HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)* is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.

### Important HTTP Request Methods

* GET - requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using `GET` should only be used to request data (they shouldn't include data),
* PUT - creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the target resource with the request payload,
* POST - sends data to the server. The type of the body of the request is indicated by the `Content-Type` header;

### Important headers

* Content-Type: provides us with the actual content type of the returned content.
